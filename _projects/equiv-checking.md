title: "Automated Alignment for Equivalence Checking"
excerpt: "The project is related to Equivalence Checking of programs with loops<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
collection: projects

* Reducing a task of equivalence checking (relational verification) to a task of safety checking of a product program
* Introducing a novel technique for equivalence checking of two programs containing loops that require a nontrivial alignment (not in lockstep composition) inside product program
